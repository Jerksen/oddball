# Intro

I'd been using the ErgoDox EZ for a couple of years, along with a regular mouse and a trackball mouse.

I really liked lots of things about it:
- split layout
- easy-ish to change layout
- multiple thumb keys
- ortho; accuracy/speed improvement

Some things were slightly frustrating:
- too many buttons; after multiple keymap iteratiions, I didn't really need everything
- accuracy still dropped, or performance slowed, when jumping to mouse and back
- pingy, however probably could have been mitigated via modding

So I:
- looked around, started tp see all thsese call boards people were making, realised it was not as complicated as I thought to design something
- read "Digital Minimalism" which recommends trying to build something physical rather than digital

Decided to try to design a keyboard with:
- minimal keys
- integrated trackball
- aesthetics of some sort

# Keymap

- minimising keys, therefore keytravel, and looks kool
- resigned myself to heavily changing layout

# Scultping

Tried a few things with playdough and old keycaps
- used golfball for trackball

# PS/2 fail-ish

Tried various mice

# Handwire

pretty standard

# Case/plate

# QMK/ADNS

// at some point give u/qqurn a note about this

# PCB

# Construction
